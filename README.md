Single-Cell analysis:
Article: "COVID-19 severity correlates with airway epitheliumâ€“immune cell interactions identified by single-cell analysis"

# Workflow / Methods
The dataset consists of single-cell RNA sequencing data from 24 patients, divided into 3 categories of severity - control, mild, and severe infection.

1. Clustering and cell annotation (see if we can recapitulate the cell annotations made in the article)

2. Trajectory analysis between mild and severe infection on subsets of both immune and lung cells (to investigate if there is a clear progression in disease)

3. Differential gene expression (DEG) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to investigate which genes are differentiated in the different subsets (cell clusters and disease severity) and connect them to biological processes.

4. Cell-cell communication: In the article, they report stronger cell-cell communication between lung epithelial and immune cells in critical patients than in mild ones. We would like to attempt to replicate this.
